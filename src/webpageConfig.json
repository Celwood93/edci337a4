        "Body": "An automobile is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation (Car, 2019). Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods (Car, 2019). Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them (Car, 2019). The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen (Car, 2019). Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company (Car, 2019). Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world (Car, 2019). Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025 (Car, 2019). There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance (Car, 2019). The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life. Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide (Car, 2019). The personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience. The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes. People’s ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies. There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide. These numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other newly industrialized countries (Car, 2019). ",

Cugnot’s vehicle was a huge, heavy, steam-powered tricycle, and his model of 1769 was said to have run for 20 minutes at 2.25 miles (3.6 km) per hour while carrying four people and to have recuperated sufficient steam power to move again after standing for 20 minutes. Cugnot was an artillery officer, and the steam-tight positions of his engine were made possible by the invention of a drill that accurately machined cannon bores. A replica of Cugnot’s second vehicle, partially original, is preserved in the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers in Paris. ",

        "Body": "Sources point to different creations as the first electric car. Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain) Robert Anderson of Scotland invented a crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells (History of the automobile, 2019). In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouve demonstrated a working three wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris (History of the automobile, 2019). English inventor Thomas Parker, who was responsible for innovations such as electrifying the London Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and the smokeless fuel coalite, built the first production electric car in London in 1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity rechargeable batteries (History of the automobile, 2019). But others regard the Flocken Elektrowagen of 1888 by German inventor Andreas Flocken as the first true electric car (History of the automobile, 2019). Electric cars enjoyed popularity between the late 19th century and early 20th century, when electricity was among the preferred methods for automobile propulsion, providing a level of comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline cars of the time. Advances in internal combustion technology, especially the electrical starter, soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of electric propulsion, effectively removing it from important markets such as the United States by the 1930s (History of the automobile, 2019).

        "Title": "Internal Combustion Engines",
        "Body": " Early attempts at making and using internal combustion engines were hampered by the lack of suitable fuels, particularly liquids, therefore the earliest engines used gas mixtures (History of the automobile, 2019).Early experimenters used gases. In 1806, Swiss engineer Francois Isaac de Rivaz built an engine powered by internal combustion of a hydrogen and oxygen mixture (History of the automobile, 2019). In 1826, Englishman Samuel Brown tested his hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by using it to propel a vehicle up Shooter’s Hill in south-east London (History of the automobile, 2019). Belgian-born Etienne Lenoir’s Hippomobile with a hydrogen-gas-fuelled one-cylinder internal combustion engine made a test drive from Paris to Joinville-le-Point in 1860, covering some nine kilometers in three hours. A later version was propelled by coal gas. In about 1870, in Vienna, Austria (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire) x put a liquid-fuelled internal combustion engine on a simple handcart which made him the first man to propel a vehicle by means of gasoline. Today, this car is known as the first Marcus car. In 1883, Marcus secured a German patent for a low voltage ignition system of the magneto type; this was his only automotive patent. The design was used for all further engines, and the four-seat second Marcus car of 1888/89 (History of the automobile, 2019). This ignition, in conjunction with the rotating-brush carburetor, made the second car’s design very innovative. His second car is on display at the Technical Museum in Vienna. During his lifetime he was honored as the originator of the motorcar but his place in history was all but erased by the Nazis during World War II. Because Marcus was of Jewish descent, the Nazi propaganda office ordered his work to be destroyed, his name expunged from future textbooks, and his public memorials removed, giving credit instead to Karl Benz (History of the automobile, 2019). It is generally acknowledged that the first really practical automobiles with petrol/gasoline powered internal combustion engines were completed almost simultaneously by several inventors working independently: Karl Benz built his first automobile in 1885 in Mannheim. Benz was granted a patent for his automobile on 29 January 1886, and began the first production of automobiles in 1888, after Bertha Benz, his wife, had proved – with the first long-distance trip in August 1888, from Mannheim to Pforzheim and back – that the horseless coach was capable of extended travel (History of the automobile, 2019). Soon after, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Stuttgart in 1889 designed a vehicle from scratch to be an automobile, rather than a horse-drawn carriage fitted with an engine. ",
